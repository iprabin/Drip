To say I spent a lot of time to build this website is an understatement, but it turned out great. I wanted to really understand jQuery so I decided to do almost everything using it. I wrote all the code myself and I used bootstrap for styling, and I think it looks really cool. I wanted to work with structured data so, I created a json object with each item because I can use JavaScript to loop through it and I don't have to repeat html code. I also designed the logo myself and use CSS to invert color on the overlay and change it when it is in different page. The cart works as well but it clears cart data when you click check out. I had to put the map in the footer along with business hour. I also didnâ€™t put the address but instead added the get direction button.
